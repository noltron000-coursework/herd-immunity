# Herd Immunity Simulation
This project is a basic simulation of *Herd Immunity*, which models how a virus moves through a population where some (but not all) of a population is vaccinated against the virus.

> #### Nolt's Note
> This project template was originally created (at least) a couple years before the COVID-19 pandemic.
> It's aged quite well; the project is even more fitting to learn with, thanks to some serious retrospective.

## Getting Started
### Running the App
1. *Fork* or *Clone* this repository into a local directory of your choice.
	- For example, you could run `git clone https://github.com/noltron000/herd-immunity`.
1. Navigate into the root of the directory with your terminal.
	- Use the `cd` command to get there.
1. Run the app with `python3 simulation.py`.
	- While you can provide command-line arguments, running the app with no arguments will make the app default to using *Ebola* virus data, with a preset population size.
	- You will see the output in your terminal.
		It will also generate a text logfile (although its contents may be exactly the same as the included textfile, so no perceivable file changes may occur).

### Terminology
TODO: Discuss statistics of viral infections throuhgout populations here. It's like actuary science!
