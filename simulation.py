'''
Main class that will run the herd immunity simulation program.
Expects initialization parameters passed as command line arguments when file is run.

Simulates the spread of a virus through a given population.
The percentage of the population that are vaccinated, the size of the population, and the amount of initially infected people in a population are all variables that can be set when the program is run.

_____Attributes______

- logger: Logger object.  The helper object that will be responsible for writing all logs to the simulation.
- population_size: Int.  The size of the population for this simulation.
- population: [Person].  A list of person objects representing all people in the population.
- next_person_id: Int.  The next available id value for all created person objects. Each person should have a unique _id value.
- virus_name: String.  The name of the virus for the simulation.  This will be passed to the Virus object upon instantiation.
- mortality_rate: Float between 0 and 1.  This will be passed to the Virus object upon instantiation.
- infection_rate: Float between 0 and 1. This will be passed to the Virus object upon instantiation.
- vaccination_rate: Float between 0 and 1. Represents the total percentage of population vaccinated for the given simulation.
- currently_infected: Int.  The number of currently people in the population currently infected with the disease in the simulation.
- total_infected: Int.  The running total of people that have been infected since the simulation began, including any people currently infected.
- total_deaths: Int.  The number of people that have died as a result of the infection during this simulation.  Starts at zero.

_____Methods_____

def __init__(population_size, vaccination_rate, virus_name, mortality_rate,
 infection_rate, initial_infected=1):
	- All arguments will be passed as command-line arguments when the file is run.
	- After setting values for attributes, calls self.create_population() in order to create the population array that will be used for this simulation.

def create_population(self, initial_infected):
	- Expects initial_infected as an Int.
	- Should be called only once, at the end of the __init__ method.
	- Stores all newly created Person objects in a local variable, population.
	- Creates all infected person objects first.  Each time a new one is created, increments infected_count variable by 1.
	- Once all infected person objects are created, begins creating healthy person objects.
		- To decide if a person is vaccinated or not, generates a random number between 0 and 1.
		- If that number is smaller than self.vaccination_rate, new person object will be created with vaccinated set to True.  Otherwise, vaccinated will be set to False.
	- Once len(population) is the same as self.population_size, returns population.
