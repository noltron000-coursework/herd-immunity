'''
	Utility class responsible for logging all interactions of note during the
	simulation.

		_____Attributes______

		file_name: the name of the file that the logger will be writing to.

		_____Methods_____

		__init__(self, file_name):

		write_metadata(self, pop_size, vaccination_rate, virus_name, mortality_rate, infection_rate):
			- Writes the first line of a logfile, which will contain metadata on the parameters for the simulation.

		log_interaction(self, person1, person2, did_infect=None, person2_vacc=None, person2_sick=None):
			- Expects person1 and person2 as person objects.
			- Expects did_infect, person2_vacc, and person2_sick as Booleans, if passed.
			- Between the values passed with did_infect, person2_vacc, and person2_sick, this method should be able to determine exactly what happened in the interaction and create a String saying so.
			- The format of the log should be "{person1.ID} infects {person2.ID}", or, for other edge cases, "{person1.ID} didn't infect {person2.ID} because {'vaccinated' or 'already sick'}"
			- Appends the interaction to logfile.

		log_infection_survival(self, person, did_die_from_infection):
			- Expects person as Person object.
			- Expects bool for did_die_from_infection, with True denoting they died from their infection and False denoting they survived and became immune.
			- The format of the log should be "{person.ID} died from infection" or "{person.ID} survived infection."
			- Appends the results of the infection to the logfile.

		log_time_step(self, time_step_number):
			- Expects time_step_number as an Int.
			- This method should write a log telling us when one time step ends, and the next time step begins.  The format of this log should be:
				"Time step {time_step_number} ended, beginning {time_step_number + 1}..."
			- STRETCH CHALLENGE DETAILS:
				- If you choose to extend this method, the format of the summary statistics logged are up to you.  At minimum, it should contain:
						- The number of people that were infected during this specific time step.
						- The number of people that died on this specific time step.
						- The total number of people infected in the population, including the newly infected
						- The total number of dead, including those that died during this time step.

	# For all other methods, we'll want to use the 'a' mode to append our new log to the end, since 'w' overwrites the file.
